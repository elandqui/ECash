# ECash

This program was part of my Honors Thesis at Virginia Tech in the fall of 1998.

This program implements an RSA-based digital cash protocol that 
  * prohibits double-spending,
  * uses blind signatures for anonymity and to make transactions untraceable, and 
  * relies on a central authority to approve transactions.

ecash.doc is the actual thesis that explains the code and the theory behind the code.
